SVD the abbreviation of Singular Value Decomposition ,is a fancy way to factorise/decompose a matrix into three other matrices (A = UΣVᵀ) where A is m x n utility matrix, U is a m x r orthogonal singular matrix, Σ is r x r square diagonal matrix of singular values ,Vt is r x n orthogonal  singular matrix.
